This template is as plain as it can be.
- No style sheets or script dependencies
- Just an HTML page setup ready to use

#### Folder structure
- 📁/root
    - 📁/logic *all your app logic should be here*
    - 📁/ui *all your user interface logic should be here*
        - 📁/schemas *auto generated JSON schemas from the [WYSIWYG Editor](#wysiwyg)*
        - 🗎 Bootstrap.js *__entry file__*
    - 📁/workers *__advanced__: place and register your service workers here*

To start just modify the Bootstrap.js file and go nuts. Don't know what to do here? Try a different [template](#templates) from the list, or head to [W3Schools JS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) to start learning and trying your skills in the WebNatives IDE.
